# Machine Learning Notes

My personal notes for the Autumn 2024 Machine Learning course at ITU. Based on the lecture content, full credits to lecturers for the original content.

Note: I stopped working on these notes early on in the course, as the exam is oral based on a dozen presentations on different subjects.
Later in the course, I decided I'd keep making them, but I'd use GPT-o1-preview to automatically summarize the slides (as I likely won't use them myself due to the nature of the exam), so please keep that in mind.
